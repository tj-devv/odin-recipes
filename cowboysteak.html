    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      A cowboy steak is a thick-cut, bone-in ribeye known for its rich marbling
      and intense beefy flavor. The long, frenched bone gives it a striking
      presentation, making it a favorite for grilling and reverse searing.
      Typically weighing around 18 - 32 ounces, this steak is best cooked to
      medium-rare or medium to preserve its juiciness and tenderness. Perfect
      for hearty appetites, the cowboy steak is a showstopper on any plate.
