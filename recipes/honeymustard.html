    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Slow-cooked honey mustard pulled pork is a tender, flavorful dish made by
      slow-cooking pork shoulder until it easily shreds apart. The pork is
      seasoned with a blend of spices and cooked in a sauce made from honey,
      mustard, garlic, and other aromatics, creating a perfect balance of sweet
      and tangy flavors. Ideal for sandwiches, tacos, or served over rice, this
      dish is a great make-ahead meal that gets even better over time.
